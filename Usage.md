# Usage
Each element in Figma has name, whether its text or a simple rectangle. This program creates all elements solely based on names. It cannot define name on its own, due to which its important to follow naming system. You can find all element names over here:

# Naming System
This is how each element should be named

1. Text - To create text type element you have to write Text_ + corresponding number such as = Text_1, Text_2, etc. Also, in text if the background has non-white color then you need to draw a small rectangle which you can embed into the background and name it as - Text_color_ + corresponding text element number such as = Text_color_1, Text_color_2, etc.
2. Rectangles/Frames - To create rectangle type element you have to write Frame (Only one color should be used as background color).
3. Button - To create button type element you have to write Button_+ type of button + _ + corresponding number such as = Button_R_1 (for rounded type button) or Button_NR_1 (for non-rounded type button) (only two are supported for now), also you need to write Button Text too which should be written in the format - B_ + corresponding button number such as B_1, B_2, etc.
4.
