You can create a pull request and then simply detail out the function you would like to be added into the program. All sorts of ideas are welcomed, you can simply even explain an idea and if its possible to add or seems necessary, then it surely will be added! If you're sharing any kind of code along with your idea, then make sure to debug it and present as a function which will be easier to add. Happy coding everyone!
